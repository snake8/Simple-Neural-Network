<h4>You can read about neural networks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">here</a>

It's basicly three layer neural network, i tested it using mnist dataset. You can download mnist <a href="https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/">here</a>.

<p>This neural network was build all from scratch (i used only this libraries, that i wrote by myself).
